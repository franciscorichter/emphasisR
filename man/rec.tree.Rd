\description{
Given a extant-species tree, it simulates extincted species on it (It should be called sim.extinct)
}
\usage{
rec.tree(tree, pars, model = "dd", seed = 0, adjustment = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{
extant species tree given by marcov process wt, n and E.
}
  \item{pars}{
parameters corresponding to diversity-dependance model
}
  \item{model}{
choose model... currently diversity-dependance only
}
  \item{seed}{
random seed for replication
}
  \item{adjustment}{
I donÂ´t know what is that
}
